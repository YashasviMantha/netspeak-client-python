# Netspeak Python Client

FULL CREDITS TO THE COOLS FOLK AT: https://github.com/netspeak/netspeak-client-java

Netspeak already offers a Java Client [Java Client](https://github.com/netspeak/netspeak-client-java); But this Client is essentially a wrapper over a Python wrapper. 

This repo is where I remove the Java stuff to use the python wrapper directly. Essentially just deleting the Java stuff. It was just eaiser to call a python function directly in my notebook over calling a java function which again calls a python function anyway. 

Please visit the netspeak guys for more information.
